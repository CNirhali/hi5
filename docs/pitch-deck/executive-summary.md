# Executive Summary: Commute Connect

## 🎯 The Problem

**Every day, millions of introverted commuters experience missed connections:**
- You notice someone interesting on your daily commute
- You're too shy to approach them directly
- You never see them again
- Another opportunity for connection is lost

**Current dating apps don't solve this:**
- They're designed for general dating, not commute-specific connections
- No real-time, location-based matching during actual commute times
- Privacy concerns with constant location sharing
- No focus on the unique dynamics of daily commuting
